2000# Machine Learning na Pr√°tica no Azure ML (DIO)

## DIO challenge for the Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals certification.

In this exercise, I used a model available at the [Microsoft Learn](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/Instructions/Labs/01-machine-learning.html) website to try the automated machine learning feature in Azure Machine Learning to train and evaluate a machine learning model. Then, I deployed and tested the trained model.

It's the same example used in the web class of the [course](https://web.dio.me/track/microsoft-azure-ai-fundamentals) but since I got a little bit lost during the explanations, I retried using the official documentation.

All the steps are available at the [Microsoft Learn page](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/Instructions/Labs/01-machine-learning.html).
